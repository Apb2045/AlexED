         <p1>About
	      
	      Alexander Babich founded AlexEd in 2012 while tutoring differential equations to college students and peers. Since 2012, we have educated hundreds of students, expanding into physics, computer science, electrical engineering, and other mathematically oriented subjects. Additionally, we have augmented the ability of students to succeed on standardized tests for college admissions including the SAT, SAT Math & Physics Subject Tests, AP Calculus & Physics, and IB Calculus. Alexander Babich has held positions as Teaching Assistant at the Grove School of Engineering in advanced Electrical Engineering courses. We have extensive experience working with students in secondary school, college, and university, from both public and private institutions.

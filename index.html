        <h3>About Us</h3>
          <p>Alexander Babich founded AlexEd in 2012 while tutoring differential equations to college students and peers. Since 2012, we have educated hundreds of students, expanding into physics, computer science, electrical engineering, and other mathematically oriented subjects. Additionally, we have augmented the ability of students to succeed on standardized tests for college admissions including the SAT, SAT Math & Physics Subject Tests, AP Calculus & Physics, and IB Calculus. Alexander Babich has held positions as Teaching Assistant at the Grove School of Engineering in advanced Electrical Engineering courses. We have extensive experience working with students in secondary school, college, and university, from both public and private institutions. </p>     
        <h3>Services</h3>     
      	  <p>AlexEd specializes in creating personal learning programs for students working to meet and exceed goals. Our programs will work for different types of learners, schedules, and deadlines. Additionally, we are available at all times to answer studentsâ€™ questions and assist them in achieving excellence. Lastly, though we believe that our services are most effective in person, AlexEd is experienced with remote access tutoring.</p>
      	 <h3>Philosophy</h3>
          <p>Though we believe that excellence in coursework is essential to progressing through secondary school education and beyond, AlexEd desires to give students a foundation for lifelong learning and a passion for discovery. </p>
